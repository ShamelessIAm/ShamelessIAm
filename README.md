- 👋 Hi, My name is Shameless
- 👀 I am a student and am learning in my free time how to code
- 🌱 When finished, I hope to be able to contribute where I can
- 💞️ I don't know what more to say here besides, I wish I knew 
- more about interpreters and how VSCode or PyCharm worked.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my email, akwr .88@protonmail.com
- Where do I begin, again...
