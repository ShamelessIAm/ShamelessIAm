# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run - this control needs switched to on when ready
off:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
